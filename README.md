# 🧠 NeuroCore Sandbox

> **RealityCodex** – Rebooting intelligence from reality upward.

This is the first experimental playground for building agents that learn meaning through **perception, feedback, and internal concept formation** — not language modeling.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To build a minimal cognitive system that:
- Interacts with a simulated world
- Forms internal representations based on experience
- Learns through feedback (e.g., pain, success)
- Evolves conceptual meaning over time

---

## 🧪 First Experiment

> An agent learns that fire = pain by interacting with the environment.  
It touches fire → receives negative signal → learns to avoid.

This will be the first proof-of-concept for grounded learning.
